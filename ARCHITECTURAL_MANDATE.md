# Checkmate V8: The Penta-Hybrid Architecture Mandate

## 1.0 Prime Directive
This document outlines the official, sanctioned architecture for the Checkmate V8 Racing Analysis Platform.

## 2.0 The Five Pillars of the Architecture

1.  **The Collection Corps (Python Service):** The headless engine responsible for all data collection, orchestration, and scheduling.
2.  **The Analysis Core (Rust Engine):** The high-performance computational engine for all intensive analysis.
3.  **The Digital Front (TypeScript Web Platform):** A modern, real-time, browser-based user interface.
4.  **The Command Deck (C# Desktop App):** A native Windows desktop application for power users.
5.  **The Familiar Frontend (Excel VBA):** A zero-friction bridge for users who live in Excel, providing direct data access and analysis capabilities.

## 3.0 Strategic Development Order

1.  ✅ SOLIDIFY THE CORE: Python Service + Rust Engine + SQLite Bridge (COMPLETE)
2.  ⚠️ BUILD THE DIGITAL FRONT: TypeScript Web Platform (IN PROGRESS)
3.  ✅ BUILD THE COMMAND DECK: C# Desktop Application (COMPLETE)
4.  ✅ BUILD THE FAMILIAR FRONTEND: Excel VBA Interface (COMPLETE)
