# ARCHITECTURAL MANDATE V9.0: THE QUAD-HYBRID PLATFORM

This document is the definitive architectural and strategic mandate for the Checkmate V8 project. It supersedes all previous architectural documents and defines the Quad-Hybrid platform as the sole North Star for all development efforts.

## 1.0 Core Principles

These principles are the non-negotiable foundation of our engineering philosophy.

-   **Multi-Lingual Specialization:** We will use the absolute best tool for each task. Python for data collection, Rust for high-performance computation, TypeScript for ubiquitous web access, and C# for a native desktop experience.

-   **The Engine Does the Thinking:** The backend (Python/Rust) is responsible for all heavy computation. It delivers pre-analyzed, scored, and qualified results to the display layers. The frontends are lean, fast, and focused on presentation.

-   **The Asynchronous Bridge:** All components are decoupled and communicate asynchronously through a shared SQLite database. This is the heart of the system, providing resilience and scalability.

-   **Assume Failure:** All components will be built with a production-grade, pessimistic mindset, incorporating robust error handling, fallbacks, and comprehensive logging.

## 2.0 The Four Pillars of the Architecture

1.  **The Collection Corps (Python Service):** A silent, autonomous Windows service. Its sole purpose is to orchestrate a fleet of data adapters, fetching and parsing real-world data concurrently.

2.  **The Analysis Core (Rust Engine):** A compiled, memory-safe, hyper-performance library. Its purpose is all heavy computation, including scoring, analysis, and future machine learning inference.

3.  **The Digital Front (TypeScript Web Platform):** A modern, real-time web application. Its purpose is to provide ubiquitous, multi-user, and mobile-responsive access to the system's data.

4.  **The Command Deck (C# Desktop App):** A native Windows desktop application. Its purpose is to provide the ultimate power-user experience with deep OS integration and zero-latency interaction.

## 3.0 Strategic Development Order

The campaign will proceed in the following strategic order, with each phase building upon the last:

1.  **SOLIDIFY THE CORE:** Python Service + Rust Engine + SQLite Bridge. (Status: ✅ COMPLETE)
2.  **BUILD THE DIGITAL FRONT:** TypeScript Web Platform. (Status: ⚠️ IN PROGRESS)
3.  **BUILD THE COMMAND DECK:** C# Desktop Application. (Status: ❌ PLANNED)
