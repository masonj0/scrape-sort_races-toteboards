# Checkmate: The Solo Solution Mandate

## 1.0 Prime Directive
This document outlines the official, sanctioned architecture for the Checkmate project. The previous Penta-Hybrid architecture is now deprecated and archived as a valuable R&D asset.

## 2.0 The New Architecture: The Pragmatic Hybrid
Our architecture is now a simple, powerful, two-pillar system designed for rapid iteration, maintainability, and direct value delivery for a solo user.

1.  **üêç The Python Backend:** A lightweight Flask (or FastAPI) service responsible for all data collection via the proven adapter pattern. It exposes a single, simple JSON API endpoint.

2.  **üåê The TypeScript Frontend:** A single, superior React component (`Checkmate Solo`) that provides the entire user experience in a modern, real-time dashboard.

## 3.0 The Central Hub
Communication is a simple, stateless HTTP request/response cycle. The complexity of a shared, persistent database is eliminated for this architecture.
