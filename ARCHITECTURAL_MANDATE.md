# Checkmate: The Ultimate Solo Mandate

## Final Architecture
The project has reached its final, perfected form: The Ultimate Solo, powered by the full strength of our CORE engine.

This architecture consists of two pillars:

1.  **The Full-Power Python Backend:** A lightweight Flask API (`api.py`) that directly leverages the production-grade `DataSourceOrchestrator` and `TrifectaAnalyzer` from our CORE `engine.py` for global data collection.

2.  **The Ultimate TypeScript Frontend:** The `Checkmate Ultimate Solo` React component, which provides the complete, production-grade operational dashboard.

All previous architectures (Penta-Hybrid, etc.) are now considered historical R&D assets and are preserved in the repository's `attic` and legacy directories.
