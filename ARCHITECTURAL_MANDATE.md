# Checkmate: The Ultimate Solo Mandate

## Final Architecture
The project has reached its final, perfected form: The Ultimate Solo.

This architecture consists of two pillars:
1.  **The Fortified Python Backend:** A lightweight Flask service leveraging our CORE `engine.py` for professional-grade data collection and analysis.
2.  **The Ultimate TypeScript Frontend:** The `Checkmate Ultimate Solo` React component, providing a complete, production-grade operational dashboard.

All previous architectures (Penta-Hybrid, etc.) are now archived as historical R&D.
