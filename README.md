# Checkmate V8: The Tri-Brid Trading Deck

A high-performance, tri-brid data analysis platform for real-time horse racing analysis, architected for a single-user Windows desktop environment.

---

## Architecture: The Tri-Brid System

This project leverages a unique three-part architecture to maximize performance, reliability, and user experience.

1.  **The Collection Corps (Python Service):** A robust, silent Windows service responsible for all data collection. It uses a fleet of concurrent adapters to fetch data from numerous sources, analyzes it, and writes the final, clean results to a central SQLite database.

2.  **The Analysis Core (Rust Engine):** A compiled, memory-safe, hyper-performance library for all heavy computational tasks. It will be called by the C# application to perform instantaneous re-analysis, filtering, and eventually, machine learning inference.

3.  **The Command Deck (C# Desktop App):** A rich, native Windows desktop application for all display and user interaction. It reads pre-analyzed data from the SQLite database with near-zero latency, providing a fluid, real-time user experience.

## Project Status

-   **[COMPLETED]** Phase 1: The Collection Corps (Python Service)
-   **[PENDING]** Phase 2: The Analysis Core (Rust Engine)
-   **[PENDING]** Phase 3: The Command Deck (C# Desktop App)
