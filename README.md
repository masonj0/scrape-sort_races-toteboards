---

## 🏛️ Project Architecture

The project is a **Quad-Hybrid + Excel** system designed for performance and flexibility:

*   **🐍 Python Service:** Handles data collection and orchestration.
*   **🦀 Rust Engine:** High-performance computational analysis.
*   **🖥️ C# Desktop App:** A native Windows "Command Deck" for power users.
*   **🌐 TypeScript Web Platform:** A modern, real-time "Live Cockpit."
*   **📊 Excel VBA Frontend:** A familiar interface for analysis and manual data stewardship.

All components are decoupled via a shared **SQLite database**.

## 🗺️ Strategic Roadmap

The current focus is on building out the user-facing applications ("Live Cockpit," "Command Deck") and formalizing the perfected Python Service logic.
