# Checkmate V8: The Sovereign Script

This repository contains the complete source code for Checkmate V8, a professional-grade horse racing analysis application. The project's current form is a single, self-contained Streamlit application that handles data collection, analysis, and a real-time user interface.

## üöÄ Quick Start

The application is designed for simplicity and immediate use.

**Prerequisites:**
*   Python 3.10+
*   An installation of R (for future analytics features)

**Installation:**
1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Install the required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

**Running the Application:**
The application is `checkmate_app.py`. To run it, use the following command in your terminal:
```bash
streamlit run checkmate_app.py
```
This will start the application and open it in your default web browser.

## üèõÔ∏è Project Architecture

The project has evolved into a state of "Sovereign Simplicity." The core of the application is **`checkmate_app.py`**, which handles:
*   **Data Collection:** A multi-adapter system for fetching race data from various sources.
*   **Analysis Engine:** A rule-based "Trifecta Analyzer" to score races.
*   **User Interface:** A real-time dashboard built with Streamlit.

## üó∫Ô∏è Strategic Roadmap

With the core application perfected, the project is focused on two primary expansion campaigns:

1.  **The Campaign for Advanced Analytics:** Integrating a **PostgreSQL** data warehouse and an **R**-based statistical modeling engine to transform the application into a predictive powerhouse.

2.  **The Familiar Frontend:** Developing a **Microsoft Excel**-based interface to make the system's data accessible to a wider audience.

## üóÉÔ∏è Digital Attic (R&D History)

This project has a rich development history. Obsolete components, architectural parables (such as the previous "Quad-Hybrid" model), and legacy scripts are preserved in the `/attic` directory for R&D and historical purposes.
