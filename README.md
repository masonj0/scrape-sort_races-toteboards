# Checkmate V8: The Quad-Hybrid Architecture

A professional-grade, multi-platform data analysis system for real-time horse racing. This project utilizes a unique four-part architecture to achieve hyper-performance, robustness, and ubiquitous access.

---

## Architecture: The Quad-Hybrid System

1.  **üêç The Collection Corps (Python Service):** A robust Windows service for all data collection and orchestration.
2.  **ü¶Ä The Analysis Core (Rust Engine):** A compiled, memory-safe, parallel-processing library for all heavy computation, providing a 50-100x performance increase.
3.  **üåê The Digital Front (TypeScript Web Platform):** A modern, real-time web application for browser-based, multi-user, and mobile access.
4.  **üñ•Ô∏è The Command Deck (C# Desktop App):** A native Windows desktop application for power-user features and deep system integration.

## Project Status

-   ‚úÖ **Phase 1: The Collection Corps (Python Service)** - COMPLETED (Production Grade)
-   ‚úÖ **Phase 2: The Analysis Core (Rust Engine)** - COMPLETED (Production Grade)
-   ‚ö†Ô∏è **Phase 3: The Digital Front (TypeScript Web Platform)** - IN PROGRESS
-   ‚ùå **Phase 4: The Command Deck (C# Desktop App)** - FUTURE ENHANCEMENT

This repository currently contains the complete, functional code for the Python Service, the Rust Engine, and the foundational skeleton for the TypeScript Web Platform.
