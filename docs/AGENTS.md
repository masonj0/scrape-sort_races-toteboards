# AGENTS.md: Vision & Guiding Principles

## The Prime Directive
To build a toolkit that identifies the best racecards for betting, focusing on structural characteristics like the number of runners and odds.

## The Architecture
The system will be a polyglot microservices architecture, where each component is built using the absolute best language for its specific job. This is a "Right Tool for the Right Job" philosophy.

## The Data Strategy
The project will follow a strict API-First principle. Our primary targets are modern GraphQL endpoints. HTML scraping is a fallback, not a primary method.

## The Quality Standard
All code will be automatically linted and formatted using Ruff. The project will be fully containerized with Docker to ensure a consistent and reproducible development environment, eliminating environmental chaos.

## The Development Process
The project will be guided by living documentation (ROADMAP.md, AGENTS.md) and will leverage "Project Nightingale" (learning from existing open-source work) to accelerate development.
