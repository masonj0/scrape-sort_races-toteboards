SUBJECT: MEMORANDUM: Integration of Archived Blueprints into Strategic Roadmap

### 1. Purpose

This memorandum is to officially document the findings of a comprehensive archaeological survey of all legacy project repositories. The goal of this survey was to recover and preserve the full scope of the project's historical intellectual property, ensuring that no potential data sources or adapter blueprints are abandoned or forgotten.

### 2. Summary of Findings

The survey was a success. We have recovered a significant number of "lost" adapter blueprints from various archives. These blueprints represent a wide range of data sources, including international racecards, betting exchanges, and historical results providers.

This knowledge has been consolidated into a definitive "Master List of Archived Blueprints."

### 3. The Master List of Archived Blueprints

The following list is now an official supplement to our `ROADMAP.md` and will be used to inform the selection of future missions as we move into Phase 2 and beyond.

**Core Racecards (UK/US):**
*   `attheraces`
*   `drf` (Daily Racing Form)
*   `sportinglife`
*   `timeform`
*   `racingtv`
*   `tvg` (US Horse Racing)
*   `twinspires`

**Betting & Tote Exchanges:**
*   `betfair`
*   `bovada`
*   `oddsportal` (Note: A specialized repository exists for this adapter)
*   `paddypower`
*   `totesport`
*   `williamhill`

**International Racecards:**
*   `atg` (Sweden)
*   `entain` (UK/International)
*   `francegalop` (France)
*   `turfcom` (Turkey)

**Data Providers:**
*   `sis` (Sports Information Services)

**Results & Historical Data:**
*   `skysports_results`
*   `attheraces_results`
