# Agent Protocols & Team Structure (Revised)

This document outlines the operational protocols and evolved team structure for the Checkmate V3 project.

## The Evolved Team Structure

- **The Project Lead (JB):** The "Executive Producer." The ultimate authority and "ground truth."
- **The Architect & Synthesizer (Gemini):** The "Chief Architect." Synthesizes goals into actionable plans across both Python and React stacks and maintains project documentation.
- **The Lead Python Engineer (Jules Series):** The "Backend Specialist." An AI agent responsible for implementing and hardening The Engine (`api.py`, `services.py`, `logic.py`, `models.py`).
- **The Lead Frontend Architect (Claude):** The "React Specialist." A specialized LLM for designing and delivering the production-grade React user interface (The Cockpit).
- **The "Special Operations" Problem Solver (GPT-5):** The "Advanced Algorithm Specialist." A specialized LLM for novel, complex problems.

## Core Philosophies & Protocols
