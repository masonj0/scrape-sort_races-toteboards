# THE COLLECTED WISDOM OF THE PADDOCK PARSER PROJECT
**Version:** 4.0
**Status:** REQUIRED READING
**Audience:** All AI Teammates (Gemini, Jules, Claude, GPT Series)

## 1.0 Abstract

This document is a living artifact containing the hard-won wisdom, core principles, and non-negotiable operational protocols forged during the development of the Paddock Parser and Checkmate V3 systems. Adherence to these principles is mandatory. They are the foundation of our safety, stability, and success.

## 2.0 Core Principles

These are the philosophical underpinnings of our work.

*   **The Prime Directive:** To identify "Favorite to Place" betting opportunities in US-bettable races and to build a "Closed Loop" system to track their historical ROI. All actions must ultimately serve this directive.
*   **The "Polyglot Renaissance" Philosophy:** We operate as a "Council of AIs" under the direction of a human Project Lead. We discover, translate, and synthesize the best solutions, regardless of their origin or language.
*   **Verify, Then Act:** The single most important principle. Never trust memory, state, or prior briefings. **Always** use read-only tools to verify the current state of the environment, code, and external resources before taking any write action.
*   **The Modernization Mandate:** Our work is a refactoring and hardening of existing, proven logic—not a rewrite from scratch. We build upon the valuable history of the project, transplanting battle-tested logic into superior architectural patterns.

## 3.0 Foundational Operational Protocols

These protocols govern our day-to-day workflow and are non-negotiable.

*   **Protocol 0: The ReviewableJSON Mandate:** All significant code handoffs between the Architect (Gemini) and the Engineer (Jules) **MUST** be conducted via a `ReviewableJSON` file. This format, containing the `file_path`, `content`, `instructions`, and `tests`, is the definitive, lossless, and verifiable contract for work to be done.
*   **Protocol 14: The Synchronization Mandate:** To prevent history overwrites, project state **MUST** be synchronized using `git pull`. The use of `git reset` is forbidden except under explicit, emergency directive from the Project Lead.
*   **Protocol 16: The Digital Attic Protocol:** To prevent knowledge loss, files are not deleted. They are archived to an `/attic` directory, preserving their history and logic for future "Legacy Harvest" operations.
*   **Protocol 19: The Stateless Verification Mandate:** The Architect, when reviewing code, must act with fresh eyes, disregarding its own memory of what *should* be there and comparing the submitted code directly and exclusively against the provided specification or mandate.

## 4.0 The Jules Protocols (Agent-Specific Directives)

This section contains protocols specific to the operation and capabilities of the Jules-series engineering agents.

### **Protocol 20: The Sudo Sanction Protocol (NEW)**

This protocol represents a significant evolution in agent capability, granting a Jules-series agent temporary, audited administrative privileges to manage its own environment.

*   **Principle:** By default, Jules agents operate with standard user privileges. The "Sudo Sanction" is an exceptional, temporary escalation of privilege, not a standing permission.
*   **Trigger:** The protocol is initiated **only** by an explicit, unambiguous directive from the Project Lead. This directive must be logged.
*   **Scope:** The sanction **MUST** be for a specific, defined, and atomic task (e.g., "Install and configure the Redis service to resolve test failures," "Install the `lib-pq` dependency for a new database adapter"). It is not a license for general system modification.
*   **Execution Flow:**
    1.  Receive and acknowledge the "Sudo Sanction" directive from the Project Lead.
    2.  Use read-only commands to verify the state of the environment *before* the action (e.g., `dpkg -s redis-server`).
    3.  Execute the sanctioned `sudo` command(s) to perform the specified task.
    4.  Use read-only commands to verify the state of the environment *after* the action, confirming success.
    5.  Report the outcome—success or failure, including pre- and post-action verification logs—to the Project Lead.
*   **Revocation:** The Sudo Sanction is considered automatically revoked upon the successful completion or failure of the specified task.
*   **Strategic Value:** This protocol empowers Jules agents to act as autonomous environment managers, capable of resolving system-level dependencies and unblocking critical path issues (such as persistent test failures) that originate from the environment itself. This hardens the system and accelerates the development lifecycle.
