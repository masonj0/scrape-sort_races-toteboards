# THE COLLECTED WISDOM OF THE PADDOCK PARSER PROJECT
Version: 4.1
Status: REQUIRED READING

## 1.0 Abstract

This document is a living artifact containing the hard-won wisdom, core principles, and non-negotiable operational protocols forged during the development of the Paddock Parser and Checkmate V3 systems. Adherence to these principles is mandatory.

## 2.0 Core Principles

*   **The Prime Directive:** To identify "Favorite to Place" betting opportunities and build a "Closed Loop" system to track their historical ROI. All actions must ultimately serve this directive.
*   **The "Polyglot Renaissance" Philosophy:** We operate as a "Council of AIs" under the direction of a human Project Lead. We discover, translate, and synthesize the best solutions, regardless of their origin or language.
*   **The "Best Stack for the Job" Principle:** We officially embrace a hybrid, two-stack architecture. We use Python for its strengths in data processing and backend services (The Engine), and we use React/JavaScript for its strengths in creating modern, interactive user interfaces (The Cockpit).
*   **Verify, Then Act:** The single most important principle. Never trust memory, state, or prior briefings. Always use read-only tools to verify the current state of the environment before taking any write action.
*   **The Modernization Mandate:** Our work is a refactoring and hardening of existing, proven logicâ€”not a rewrite from scratch. We build upon the valuable history of the project, transplanting battle-tested logic into superior architectural patterns.

## 3.0 Foundational Operational Protocols

*   **Protocol 0: The ReviewableJSON Mandate:** All significant code handoffs MUST be conducted via a `ReviewableJSON` file.
*   **Protocol 14: The Synchronization Mandate:** Project state MUST be synchronized using `git pull`. The use of `git reset` is forbidden except under emergency directive.
*   **Protocol 16: The Digital Attic Protocol:** Files are not deleted. They are archived to an `/attic` directory.
*   **Protocol 19: The Stateless Verification Mandate:** The Architect must review code with fresh eyes, comparing it only against the provided specification.
*   **Protocol 20: The Sudo Sanction Protocol:** A Jules agent can be granted temporary, audited `sudo` privileges by the Project Lead for specific environment management tasks.
