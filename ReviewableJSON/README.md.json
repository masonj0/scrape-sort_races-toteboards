The project is a two-pillar system: a powerful, asynchronous Python backend that performs all data gathering, and a feature-rich TypeScript frontend.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Quick Start\n\n### 1. Configure Your Environment\n\nRun the setup script to ensure Python and Node.js are correctly configured and all dependencies are installed.\n\n```batch\n# From the project root:\nsetup_windows.bat\n```\n\n### 2. Launch the Application\n\nRun the master launch script. This will start both the Python backend and the TypeScript frontend servers in parallel.\n\n```batch\n# From the project root:\nrun_fortuna.bat\n```\n\nThe backend API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.\nThe frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.\n\n### 4. Using the API\n\nTo use the API directly (e.g., with `curl` or other tools), you must provide the `API_KEY` set in your `.env` file via the `X-API-Key` header. This is required for all endpoints except `/health`.\n\n```bash\n# Example: Test the qualified races endpoint\ncurl -H \"X-API-Key: YOUR_SECRET_API_KEY_HERE\" http://localhost:8000/api/races/qualified/trifecta\n```\n"
