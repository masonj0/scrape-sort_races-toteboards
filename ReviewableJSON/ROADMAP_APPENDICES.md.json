It contains our long-term goals and a library of resources to accelerate development.\n\n---\n\n## Appendix A: V3 Adapter Backlog (The \"Treasure Chest\")\n\nThis is the definitive, prioritized list of data sources to be implemented.\n\n### Category 1: High-Value Data Feeds (API-First)\n*   BetfairDataScientistThoroughbred\n*   BetfairDataScientistGreyhound\n*   racingandsports\n*   sportinglife (requires investigation)\n*   racingpost (requires auth)\n\n### Category 2: Premium Global Sources (Scraping)\n*   timeform\n*   attheraces\n*   racingtv\n*   oddschecker\n*   betfair\n*   horseracingnation\n*   brisnet\n\n### Category 3: North American Authorities & ADWs\n*   equibase\n*   drf\n*   fanduel\n*   twinspires\n*   1stbet\n*   nyrabets\n*   xpressbet\n\n### Category 4: European Authorities & Markets\n*   francegalop\n*   deutschergalopp\n*   svenskgalopp\n*   pmu\n\n### Category 5: Asia-Pacific & Rest of World\n*   tab\n*   punters\n*   racingaustralia\n*   hkjc\n*   jra\n*   goldcircle\n*   emiratesracing\n\n### Category 6: Specialized Disciplines (Harness & Greyhound)\n*   usta\n*   standardbredcanada\n*   harnessracingaustralia\n*   gbgb\n*   grireland\n*   thedogs\n\n---\n\n## Appendix B: Open-Source Intelligence Leads\n\nA curated list of projects and resources to accelerate development.\n\n1.  **joenano/rpscrape:** https://github.com/joenano/rpscrape\n2.  **Daniel57910/horse-scraper:** https://github.com/Daniel57910/horse-scraper\n3.  **Web Scraping for HKJC:** https://gist.github.com/tomfoolc/ef039b229c8e97bd40c5493174bca839\n3.  **Web Scraping for HKJC:** https://gist.github.com/tomfoolc/ef039b229c8e97bd40c5493174bca839\n4.  **LibHunt horse-racing projects:** https://www.libhunt.com/topic/horse-racing\n5.  **Web data scraping blog:** https://www.3idatascing.com/how-does-web-data-scraping-help-in-horse-racing-and-greyhound/\n6.  **Fawazk/Greyhoundscraper:** https://github.com/Fawazk/Greyhoundscraper\n7.  **Betfair Hub Models Scraping Tutorial:** https://betfair-datascientists.github.io/tutorials/How_to_Automate_3/\n8.  **scrapy-horse-racing:** https://github.com/chrism-attmann/scrapy-horse-racing\n9.  **horse-racing-data:** https://github.com/jeffkub/horse-racing-data\n\n\n## C. Un-Mined Gems (Future Campaign Candidates)\n\n*Discovered during a full operational review. These represent high-value, validated concepts from the project's history that are candidates for future development campaigns.*\n\n### C1. The Intelligence Layer (\"The Analyst\")\n\n- **Concept:** A dedicated analysis and scoring engine (`analyzer.py`) that sits on top of the `OddsEngine`. It would provide a high-value `/api/races/qualified` endpoint, transforming the API from a data funnel into a source of actionable intelligence.\n- **Origin:** Inspired by the `TrifectaAnalyzer` logic in the legacy `checkmate_engine.py` prototype. Formally proposed as \"Operation: Activate the Analyst\".\n- **Value:** Fulfills the project's original vision of finding opportunities, not just collecting data. Creates a clean architectural separation between data collection and business logic.\n\n### C2. The Legacy Test Suite (\"The Oracle's Library\")\n\n- **Concept:** Repurpose the vast collection of existing tests and mock data located in `attic/legacy_tests_pre_triage`.\n- **Origin:** Identified during the full repository file catalog audit.\n- **Value:** Provides a massive shortcut to production hardening. Allows the project to increase test coverage and resilience by validating the CORE services against hundreds of historical edge cases.\n\n### C3. The AI Architectural Reviews (\"The Council's Wisdom\")\n\n- **Concept:** Synthesize the expert analysis and architectural recommendations from the multiple AI model reviews stored in the Digital Attic (`*.md.txt` files).\n- **Origin:** Explicitly mentioned in the Gemini928 handoff memo as \"Architectural Parables\".\n- **Value:** A source of high-level architectural consulting. These documents may contain actionable advice on performance, security, or design patterns that could significantly improve the current architecture.\n\n### C4. The Interactive Dashboard Prototype (\"The Command Deck\")\n\n- **Concept:** Create a modern, internal, real-time command deck for visualizing engine data and testing new `Analyzer` models.\n- **Origin:** Inspired by the `portable_demo_v2.py` Streamlit application from the attic.\n- **Value:** An invaluable tool for development, debugging, and real-time operational insight, far more intuitive than raw logs or API calls."
