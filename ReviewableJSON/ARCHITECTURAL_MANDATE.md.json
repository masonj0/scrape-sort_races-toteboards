    "content": "# The Checkmate Architectural Mandate (V2)\n\n## The Prime Directive: The Two-Pillar System\n\nThe project's architecture is a lean, hyper-powerful, two-pillar system: The **\"Ultimate Solo.\"** This design was chosen for its clarity, maintainability, and performance, representing the hard-won victory over the complexity of previous multi-language architectures.\n\n## Pillar 1: The Asynchronous Python Backend\n\nThe backend is a modern, asynchronous service built on **FastAPI**. Its architecture is defined by the principles in `checkmate_pseudocode.md.txt` and includes:\n\n1.  **The `OddsEngine`:** A central, async orchestrator responsible for managing the data collection lifecycle.\n2.  **The Resilient `BaseAdapter`:** A sophisticated abstract base class that provides all adapters with built-in, professional-grade features like `httpx` connection pooling, automatic retries with exponential backoff, and standardized error handling.\n3.  **The Adapter Fleet:** A modular system of 'plugin' adapters that inherit from the `BaseAdapter`, each responsible for a single data source.\n4.  **Pydantic Data Contracts:** Strict, validated Pydantic models are used for all data, ensuring type safety and data integrity throughout the entire application.\n\n## Pillar 2: The Ultimate TypeScript Frontend\n\nThe frontend is a modern, feature-rich web application built on **Next.js** and **TypeScript**. It provides the complete, production-grade operational dashboard for the end-user."
