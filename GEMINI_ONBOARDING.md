# Checkmate V8: Golden Links Directory for New Agents

**Objective:** To provide a new AI agent with the essential, up-to-date files for understanding the project's **current and final architecture**.

**Critical Note:** The project has undergone a significant strategic pivot. All previous multi-language architectures (Python/Rust/C#/TypeScript) are **obsolete** and have been archived. The project's final form is a single, sovereign Python script using Streamlit. The list below reflects this final state.

---

### **1. The Sovereign Script (The Entire Application)**

This is the most important file. It contains the complete, perfected code for the entire Checkmate V8 system. Understanding this file is the primary goal.

```

### **2. Project Dependencies**

These are the specific, pinned Python packages required to run the Sovereign Script.

### **4. Historical Architectural Documents (For Context)**

These documents describe the previous, now-obsolete architectures. They are useful for understanding the project's evolution but do not describe the current system.
