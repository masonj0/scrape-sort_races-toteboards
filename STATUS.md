## Active Campaigns

With the core system stabilized, we are now proceeding with the **"Campaign for Production Hardening."**

## Immediate Priorities

Based on the latest architectural reviews, the next priorities are:

1.  **Harden C# Command Deck:** Replace placeholder logging (`Console.WriteLine`) with a professional logging framework.
2.  **Complete TypeScript UI:** Replace placeholder UI components (`RaceCard.tsx`, `TrifectaFactors.tsx`) with dynamic, data-driven implementations.
3.  **Secure the System:** Begin implementing the security recommendations from the architectural audits, starting with authentication on the web platform.
