# Project Status: Green

**Date:** 2025-09-29

## Health & Vitals

*   **Architectural Stability:** GOOD. The project is aligned with the sanctioned **Quad-Hybrid + Excel** architecture. The Python Service component has been perfected in a prototype (`checkmate_app.py`) and is ready for formal integration.

*   **Integration Integrity:** NOMINAL. Core integration points (SQLite database, Rust FFI) are defined. The TypeScript web platform and C# desktop application require further development to be fully integrated.

*   **Agent Status:** NOMINAL. Jules930 is online and executing directives.

## Active Campaigns

1.  **"The Live Cockpit":** Development of the TypeScript/React web application.
2.  **"The Command Deck":** Development of the C# native Windows desktop application.
3.  **"The Familiar Frontend":** Implementation of the Microsoft Excel VBA interface.

## Immediate Priorities

1.  Formalize the Python Service by migrating logic from the `checkmate_app.py` prototype.
2.  Build out the API surface in the TypeScript `api_gateway`.
