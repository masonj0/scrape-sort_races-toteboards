# Project Status: Foundation Rebuilt, Hardening in Progress

**Date:** 2025-10-03

## Current State

*   **Architecture:** The backend has been successfully rebuilt into a superior, asynchronous FastAPI application, as defined by 'Operation: Grand Synthesis'. The new foundation is stable, tested, and features a resilient `BaseAdapter` pattern.

*   **Status:** The foundational refactoring is complete. The first two data adapters (`Betfair`, `TVG`) have been implemented on the new architecture. We are now in a new phase of development: **'Phase 2: Hardening & Expansion.'**

*   **Documentation:** All core strategic documents and manifests have been synchronized with the new technical reality.

*   **Next Steps:** Our immediate priority is to act on the verified intelligence from our Oracle (Jules1003). The next missions will focus on implementing critical API security features (rate limiting, authentication) and continuing the build-out of our adapter fleet.
