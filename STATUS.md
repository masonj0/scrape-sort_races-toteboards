# Project Status: Green

**Date:** 2025-09-29

## Health & Vitals

*   **Architectural Stability:** EXCELLENT. The Penta-Hybrid architecture is sanctioned. The Python service has a new, stable entry point. A production-grade build system and code quality tooling (`Ruff`) are in place.

*   **Agent Status:** NOMINAL. Jules930 is online and executing directives.

## Active Campaigns

1.  **"The Live Cockpit":** Development of the TypeScript/React web application.
2.  **"The Command Deck":** Hardening of the C# native Windows desktop application.
3.  **"The Familiar Frontend":** Finalizing the Microsoft Excel VBA interface.
4.  **Historical Record Maintenance:** The `HISTORY.md` file is now a CORE document and will be actively updated with major project milestones.

## Immediate Priorities

1.  Fortify the C# Command Deck by implementing a proper logging framework.
2.  Complete the placeholder logic in the TypeScript "Live Cockpit" UI components.
