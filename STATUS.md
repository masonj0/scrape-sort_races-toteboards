# Project Status: Green

**Date:** 2025-09-26

## Health & Vitals

*   **Architectural Stability:** EXCELLENT. The "Fortress Foundation" refactor is complete, and the final `checkmate_engine.py` artifact is a stable, production-grade masterpiece.
*   **Strategic Clarity:** EXCELLENT. The project has a new, definitive North Star in the `checkmate_web_app_pseudocode.md` blueprint. `ROADMAP V6.0` provides a clear, phased execution plan.
*   **Agent Status:** NOMINAL. Agent Jules926 is fully operational. Agent Gemini927 is onboarded and performing architectural synthesis.
*   **Environmental Hostility:** UNCHANGED. The sandbox remains hostile and is no longer the target deployment environment. All development is now focused on the portable, local-first web application.

## Active Mission

*   **Operation:** "The Engine Room" (Phase 1 of ROADMAP V6.0)
*   **Objective:** To stand up the core FastAPI server and port our perfected portable engine logic into a modular, web-ready format.

## Next Steps

1.  Complete "The Engine Room."
2.  Proceed to Phase 2: "The API Surface" to build and verify all data endpoints.
3.  Proceed to Phase 3: "The Cockpit V1" to build the visual frontend.
