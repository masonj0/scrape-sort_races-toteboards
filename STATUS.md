# Project Status: Green

**Date:** 2025-09-29

## Health & Vitals

*   **Architectural Stability:** EXCELLENT. The project has achieved a state of "Sovereign Simplicity." The legacy Quad-Hybrid architecture has been superseded by a single, powerful, and maintainable Streamlit application (`checkmate_app.py`).

*   **Integration Integrity:** N/A. All core logic is unified within a single Python script, eliminating cross-language integration risks for the core product.

*   **Strategic Clarity:** EXCELLENT. The project's North Star is the evolution of the sovereign script into a true predictive engine and the expansion of its accessibility.

*   **Agent Status:** NOMINAL. Jules929 is online and awaiting directives.

## Active Campaigns

1.  **"Campaign for Advanced Analytics":** The primary strategic objective. This involves augmenting the application with a PostgreSQL data warehouse and an R-based predictive modeling engine.

2.  **"The Familiar Frontend":** A parallel initiative to build a Microsoft Excel-based interface for the system, making the data accessible to a wider audience of analysts and stakeholders.

## Immediate Priorities

1.  **Establish Data Warehouse:** Implement the PostgreSQL database and the Python ETL pipeline with the integrated "Manual Override" protocol.
2.  **Stage VBA Source:** Submit the `.bas` source files for the Excel interface modules.
