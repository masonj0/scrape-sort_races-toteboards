# Project Status: Green

**Date:** 2025-09-28

## Health & Vitals

*   **Architectural Stability:** EXCELLENT. The Quad-Hybrid architecture is defined and validated. The core Python/Rust engine is production-grade.

*   **Integration Integrity:** EXCELLENT. Critical bugs in the Python-to-Rust interface have been fixed, and the production build process is now sound.

*   **Strategic Clarity:** EXCELLENT. The `ARCHITECTURAL_MANDATE.md` provides a clear vision. The immediate priority is the completion of the TypeScript Web Platform.

*   **Agent Status:** NOMINAL. Jules927 is online and performing flawlessly.

## Active Campaign: "Campaign for the Digital Front"

*   **Objective:** To build and deploy the complete TypeScript web application, providing browser-based, real-time access to our data.

## Immediate Priorities (Next Mission)

1.  **Complete the API Gateway:** Fully implement the TypeScript API server with database integration and live WebSocket updates.

2.  **Implement the Frontend:** Build the core React components (`LiveRaceDashboard`, etc.) to display the live data.

3.  **Enhance the Database:** Apply all schema updates, including new performance indexes and web-specific tables.
