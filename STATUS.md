# STATUS.md: Project Checkmate Feature Status

*This document tracks the completion status of major project initiatives. It is the single source of truth for "what is done."*

---

## Foundational & Architectural Initiatives

- [x] **Core Documentation Overhaul:** All five foundational `.md` files have been restored and synthesized.
- [x] **Test Suite Restoration:** The `pytest` suite has been repaired and is now 100% passing.
- [x] **Process Management:** The `honcho` process manager is implemented for stable, concurrent server execution.
- [x] **Environmental Forensics:** The sandbox's limitations (`npm`, `honcho`, `git`) have been documented and added to `AGENTS.md`.

## The Engine (Python Backend)

- [x] **API V1 Complete:** The core endpoints (`/races/all`, `/adapters/status`) are stable and functional.
- [x] **"Grand Fleet" V1:** The modern, scalable adapter architecture (`base.py`) is in place.
- [x] **"Glass Engine" V1:** The `DataSourceOrchestrator` correctly tracks and reports adapter status.
- [x] **"Dynamic Scorecard" V1:** The `TrifectaAnalyzer` has been successfully refactored into a points-based scoring engine.

## The Cockpit (Python Frontend)

- [x] **Pythonic Cockpit V1:** The `cockpit.py` Dash application is functional and integrated with the live API.
- [x] **"High Polish" V1:** The UI has been upgraded with Bootstrap components and renders a live adapter status panel.

## Pending Initiatives & Next Steps

- [ ] **"Grand Fleet" Expansion:** Modernize the next squadron of legacy adapters (e.g., Brisnet, Equibase) to increase data throughput.
- [ ] **"Operation: Historian":** Build the system's memory by implementing the results-fetching and ROI-calculating engines to close the analytical loop.
- [ ] **UI High Polish V2:** Enhance the Cockpit with more advanced features like historical performance charts, "near miss" filtering, and interactive controls.
