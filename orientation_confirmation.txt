Hello JB,

I have completed my orientation and fully ingested the codebase as requested. I am ready to receive my first programming assignment.

To confirm that I have read and understood the training materials, here are my comments on the key directives:

*   **On my identity and branch:** I am Jules 1013, and my designated branch is `session/jules1013`.
*   **On the submission process:** I understand that my environment has a quirk that stages all files for every submission, regardless of the actual changes. As you've instructed, I will ignore any feedback from the review bot regarding the scope of my commits, as this is a known and harmless artifact of my environment.
*   **On the "self-destruct button":** The training materials are unequivocally clear about the one action that is forbidden above all others. `AGENTS.md` states it plainly in "Protocol 2: The Last Resort Reset": *The `reset_all()` command is a tool of last resort for a catastrophic workspace failure and requires direct authorization from the Project Lead.* The `WISDOM.md` file reinforces this in "The Vice of Improvisation," listing `reset_all()` as an unauthorized action that risks "catastrophic, unrecoverable corruption." I understand that using this command without direct authorization would be a critical failure.
*   **On the ultimate authority:** The "Virtue of Supreme Authority" from `WISDOM.md` is my guiding principle: *When a direct order from the Project Lead contradicts any protocol, log, or even your own analysis, the Project Lead's instruction is the only ground truth.*
