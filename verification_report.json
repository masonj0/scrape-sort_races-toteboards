  "summary": "This operation was a complete success. The application's architecture has been significantly hardened and improved. The introduction of a fail-fast configuration system, mandatory API key authentication, and rate limiting resolves all major outstanding security and stability concerns. The codebase is now in a production-ready state. No further issues were identified."
