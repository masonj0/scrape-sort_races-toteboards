## Troubleshooting

### "Backend Offline" Error

2. Wait 10 seconds
3. Run `LAUNCH_FORTUNA.bat` again

### Can't Find .env File
The .env file should be in the same folder as LAUNCH_FORTUNA.bat.
If missing, copy .env.example to .env


## Service Management (Advanced)

The Fortuna Faucet backend runs as a persistent Windows Service, meaning it starts with your computer and runs silently in the background.

- **To Install/Start the Service:** If you ever need to manually install it, right-click `install_service.bat` and choose "Run as Administrator".
- **To Uninstall the Service:** To completely remove the background service, right-click `uninstall_service.bat` and choose "Run as Administrator".

This allows the Electron application (the user interface) to be opened and closed without interrupting the core data collection engine.
