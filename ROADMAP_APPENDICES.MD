## Appendix B: Open Source Intelligence & Technology Watchlist

A curated list of noteworthy technologies and projects for future consideration.

*   **PDF Parsing Technology:** The `pdfplumber` library has been identified as a potentially superior alternative to our current PDF parsing methods. It should be the primary candidate for any future refactoring of the `ResultsParser`.
*   **`kenthunt/chart-parser`:** [https://github.com/kenthunt/chart-parser](https://github.com/kenthunt/chart-parser) - A highly relevant, offline PDF chart parser that serves as an excellent architectural reference.
*   **`ccmd00d/handycapper`:** [https://github.com/ccmd00d/handycapper](https://github.com/ccmd00d/handycapper) - Another open-source project in the same domain, valuable for comparative analysis and identifying alternative data sources or techniques.

## CAMPAIGN COMPLETE: The Windows Experience (Phases 1-3)

**Date of Completion:** 2025-10-15

**Summary:** This strategic campaign was a complete success. The operator's toolkit and user experience have been elevated from a collection of simple scripts to a cohesive, intelligent, and resilient A+ grade system. The core objectives have been met and exceeded.

**Key Achievements:**

-   **Bulletproof Installer (`INSTALL_FORTUNA.bat`):** The setup process is now fully automated and resilient, featuring pre-flight system checks, parallel dependency installation, and a self-healing 'Full Reset' mode.
-   **Interactive Configuration (`setup_wizard.py`):** Manual `.env` file editing has been eliminated and replaced with a foolproof, interactive configuration wizard.
-   **Intelligent Launcher (`LAUNCH_FORTUNA.bat`):** The launch sequence is now significantly faster and more reliable, with automated port conflict resolution and an active health-check loop.
-   **Professional Monitoring (CLI & GUI):** Operators now have two powerful, real-time monitoring tools: the `fortuna_status_cli.py` for a live terminal dashboard, and the `FortunaAdvancedMonitor` for a full-fledged graphical command deck.
-   **Unified Command Console (`SERVICE_MANAGER.bat`):** All individual scripts have been unified under a single, user-friendly, menu-driven service manager, providing a 'single pane of glass' for all common operations.
