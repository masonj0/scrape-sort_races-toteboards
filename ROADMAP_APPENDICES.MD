## 🚀 Phase 1: Instant Gratification (Quick Wins)

*   **System Tray Integration:** Create a native Windows system tray icon with full app control. The app will run in the background without cluttering the taskbar, providing a professional, modern Windows feel.
*   **Native Windows Notifications:** Pop up Windows 10/11 toast notifications when high-value opportunities appear, ensuring the operator never misses a critical race.
*   **Smart Startup Configuration:** Implement a `configure_startup.py` script to allow the user to easily enable or disable the application from launching on Windows startup.

## 🎨 Phase 2: Professional Polish

*   **Custom Branded Installer:** Create a single-click Inno Setup installer with a branded UI, making the application distributable as a single, professional `.exe` file.
*   **Enhanced Monitor with Live Charts:** Upgrade the `fortuna_monitor.py` GUI to include real-time performance graphs using Matplotlib, transforming it from a status board into a visual diagnostic tool.
*   **Keyboard Shortcuts & Accessibility:** Implement Windows-standard keyboard shortcuts (F5, Ctrl+R, etc.) into the monitor for power users.

## 💎 Phase 3: Elite Features

*   **Multi-Monitor Support:** Architect the GUI to support detachable panels that can be moved to a secondary monitor, allowing for a true command center experience.
*   **Export & Reporting:** Implement a `RaceExporter` to provide one-click export of qualified races to professionally formatted Excel, PDF, or clipboard.
*   **Audio Alerts:** Add customizable sound alerts for high-value races, ensuring critical opportunities are never missed.

## 🔧 Phase 4: Power User Tools

*   **Custom Filters & Saved Searches:** Create a system for saving and loading `FilterProfile` configurations, allowing the user to instantly apply their favorite analysis set-ups.
*   **Historical Performance Dashboard:** Build a dedicated analytics dashboard for backtesting and tracking the system's long-term accuracy and ROI.
*   **Dark/Light Theme Toggle:** Implement a system-aware theme switcher for the GUI to match the user's native Windows theme.
