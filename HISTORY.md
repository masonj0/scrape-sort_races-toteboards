## Chapter 6: The Symbiotic Era - The Two Stacks (mid-September 2025)

*   Narrative: This chapter marks the project's most significant strategic pivot. The Council, in a stunning display of its "Polyglot Renaissance" philosophy, produced a complete, production-grade React user interface, authored by the Claude agent. This event formally split the project's architecture into two powerful, parallel streams: the Python Engine and the React Cockpit.

This new era moves beyond simple modernization and into a new phase of true, multi-stack synthesis, with the immediate goal of achieving a perfect symbiosis between the two systems.
