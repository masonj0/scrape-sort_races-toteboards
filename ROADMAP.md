# Paddock Parser V3: Grand Unified Roadmap (Revised)

This document represents the definitive strategic vision, reflecting our evolution into a hybrid Python/React system.

---

## Part 1: The V3 Strategic Pillars (Our Philosophy)

(All existing pillars remain in effect: Defense, Intelligence, Hybrid Cognition, Ethics.)

---

## Part 2: The New Reality: The Hybrid System

The project's architecture has been formalized into two distinct but connected systems:

*   **The Engine (Python Backend):** A powerful, headless API server responsible for all data acquisition, analysis, and persistence. Its features are documented under the V2 "Golden Branch" section.
*   **The Cockpit (React Frontend):** A production-grade React application that serves as the project's primary user interface. It is the definitive "Face" of the system.

## Part 3: The "Symbiosis" Endgame (September 2025)

The "Checkmate" Endgame has evolved. The new Prime Directive is to achieve a perfect, seamless integration between our powerful Python Engine and our beautiful React Cockpit.

### The New Prime Directive: "Operation: Symbiosis"

The application's purpose is to connect the live, analytical data from the Python backend to the React frontend, creating a single, cohesive, and powerful user experience. All future development will be in service of this integration.

### The "Closed Loop" Architecture

The three engines (Prediction, Historian, Accountant) will be implemented within the Python backend. The React frontend will provide the interface for visualizing the data from these engines, including the cumulative P/L graph which remains the project's ultimate report card.
